# TDS Project 1
##  I used the GitHub API and retrieved profiles of users in Shanghai with over 200 followers, along with up to 500 of each user's public repositories. I cleaned and formatted the data, especially company namesâ€”and saved it to CSV files to make it ready for easy analysis.

## Interestingly, the highest average stars per repository were found in repositories using Rich Text Format, showing that well documentated projects are more engaging for the users.

## To grow your visibility among top developers in Shanghai, consider creating JavaScript or Go projects, or contribute to existing popular ones. Focusing on public repositories and follower engagement could help you establish a stronger network within the Shanghai developer community.
