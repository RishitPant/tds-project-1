# TDS Project 1
-  I used the GitHub API and retrieved profiles of users in Shanghai with over 200 followers along with up to 500 of each user's public repositories, then cleaning and formating the data, especially company names—and saved it to CSV files to make it ready for easy analysis.

- Interestingly, the highest average stars per repository were found in repositories using Rich Text Format, showing that well documentated projects are more engaging for the users.

- To grow your visibility among top developers in Shanghai, consider creating JavaScript or Go projects, or contribute to existing popular ones, alongside focusing on public repositories and follower engagement could help you establish a stronger network within the Shanghai developer community.
